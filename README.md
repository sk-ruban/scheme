# Learning Scheme: My Journey Through Lisp

Welcome to this repository, where I document my journey of learning Scheme, a major dialect of the Lisp programming language. This journey is not just about code; it's about understanding the philosophical underpinnings and the powerful abstractions that Lisp offers.

## What is Scheme?

Scheme is a minimalist dialect of Lisp, known for its clean semantics and simple syntax. It's designed to be a practical language that embodies the principle that a small, expressive core can be used to build powerful abstractions.

## Resources

I am using the following two texts:

1. **The Little Schemer** âœ… - _Completed!_ A delightful introduction to thinking in Scheme (and Lisp in general), this book teaches through a conversational style that challenges the reader to think about problems in a recursive way.
2. **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)** ðŸš§ - _Currently working through it._ Often considered the bible of computer science, SICP uses Scheme to introduce fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.

## Repository Structure

- `/little-schemer` - Exercises and notes from "The Little Schemer".
- `/sicp` - Exercises, notes, and project files from "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs".

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the directories, read notes, and try out exercises. If you're also learning Scheme or are curious about any aspect of my journey, don't hesitate to open an issue for a discussion!

## Contributing
